Path plan
=========

This document contains various ideas regarding what to be implemented, in which order
and perhaps some brief descriptions of the features.

**Data types**

Every serious data computing platform must lie on a well-done type system.
Java offers some built-in data types. In order to achieve a reasonable performance,
the use of value types built-in in Java is a must. Boxing/unboxing is a 
performance bottleneck.


After types, perhaps the linear model regression (OLS) would be the best bet.
That would need a good interface for regressor and also a good way to 
build formulas.




Tasks
------

* Binary implementation - ok
* Ordered implementation - ok
* Stamp implementation - postponed/really needed?
