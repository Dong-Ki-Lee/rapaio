/**
 * QR Decomposition.
 * <p/>
 * For an m-by-n matrix A with m >= n, the QR decomposition is an m-by-n
 * orthogonal matrix Q and an n-by-n upper triangular matrix R so that
 * A = Q*R.
 * <p/>
 * The QR decompostion always exists, even if the matrix does not have
 * full rank, so the constructor will never fail.  The primary use of the
 * QR decomposition is in the least squares solution of nonsquare systems
 * of simultaneous linear equations.  This will fail if isFullRank()
 * returns false.
