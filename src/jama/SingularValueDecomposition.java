/**
 * Singular Value Decomposition.
 * <p/>
 * For an m-by-n matrix A with m >= n, the singular getValue decomposition is an
 * m-by-n orthogonal matrix U, an n-by-n diagonal matrix S, and an n-by-n
 * orthogonal matrix V so that A = U*S*V'.
 * <p/>
 * The singular values, sigma[k] = S[k][k], are ordered so that sigma[0] >=
 * sigma[1] >= ... >= sigma[n-1].
 * <p/>
 * The singular getValue decompostion always exists, so the constructor will never
 * fail. The matrix condition number and the effective numerical rank can be
 * computed from this decomposition.
